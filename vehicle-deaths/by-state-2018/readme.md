# Vehicle death data!

Tim extracted these csv files 21 October 2020 from https://www.iihs.org/topics/fatality-statistics/detail/state-by-state#deaths-by-road-user.

IIHS is the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety; these data are realted to (and maybe derived from) the FARS: the Fatal Accident Reporting System, which lists many details about every single fatal accident that involves a vehicle. Amazing.

But this, though still cool is data aggregated by State. 

Perfect practice for the "join" data move. :)
